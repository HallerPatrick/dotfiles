= Conformance Checking - Alignment-based Techniques =

== Idea ==

Assessing conformance based on alignment of activities and events.
    * Consider set of activites of the model as set of symbols
    * each execution sequence of model is a sequence of symbols
    * each trace of the event log is also a sequence of symbols


== Approach ==

1. Definition of alignments
2. Construction of alignments
3. Conformance measures


Apply costs to moves:
* 1 value for move in log
* 1 value for move in model
* 0 value for equal move
* INF for different move

== Problem of finding optimal allignments ==

Seach space is product of statespace of model and trace

Find shortest path in in weighted directed graph. -> Dijkstra or A*

== Conformance Analysis ==

Alignments enable quantification of conformance of event logs w.r.t. a process model.

Issues that are avoided with Alignments:
    * Silent transitions do not need to be treated
    * Duplicated transitions in the model can be integrated
      directly
      
Alignments form basis not only for conformance analysis, but full range of analysis techniques.

== Local Feedback in Trace/Model ==

For relational conformance instread of considering elements of behavioral
relations as entities for feedback, the violation pair is used
-> Frequent occurence of such a pair hints at hotspots


== Global Feedback in Trace/Model ==

== More efficient alignment construction ==

* Define more advanced heuristic to guide the search
* Prune searchspace
* Introduce second order priorisation for candidate states
 in the exploration
* Reuse results in the computation
* Caching

Techniques:
    * Parikh Vector
    * Incidence Matrix
    * Marking Equation

== Assessing alignmentd-based measures ==

=== Fitness Measures ===

=== Assess Precision ===

* Based on traces of the log, characterise states in the model
with "escaping edges"
* Those transitions represent behavior that immediately follows behavior of the
log but is not contained in the log


== Multiple Trace Aligment ==
