= Logs Defintion =

Logs contain information to answer questions
    - *When* are process instances executed?
    - *How* many instances have been executed?
    - Are there recurring patterns?
    - Is it possible to construct process models based on log data?
    - Frequent execution of activities
    - Unexecuted execution sequences

-> Logs are evidence to answer these questions

Specific model that imposes assumptions on event logs, that:

    - There is a total order of events
    - Every event can be related to activity and process instance
    - Each even relates to instance of single process

But, actual logs contains events of various processes and requires pre-processing
