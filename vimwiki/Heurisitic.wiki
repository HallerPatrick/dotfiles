= Heurisitic =

Heurisitic algorithm are based on deterministic algorithm,
but incorporate frequencies of events and traces for
reconstructing a process model.

Challenges problem about noise in event logs, which are a problem
in alpha technique. Leads to wrong construction of process model.

Real world process are highly complex and discovery
can lead to complex models.

-> Reduction of model through frequency measurements.


== Heurisitic Miner == 

Exploits frequency to estimate flow probabilities.


Approach:

1. Construction of frequency table
2. Induction of dependency graph
3. Construction of net system from frequency table and dependency graph
