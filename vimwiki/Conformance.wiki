= Conformance Checking =

Assumes that process model represented desires process.
Given event log is compared with the ideal model to 
identify conformance or deviant behavior. 

The process instances in the log as cases are replayed
as simulations in the model. Cases that can be replayed
are labeled as conform and others as deviant.

== Replay Based ==

Replay and look for local feedback in model, like:
    - Transition fires although it isn not enabled
    - Tokens remain in the net and are not consumed

Local diagnostics can be performed that highlight the nodes in the mode
where deviations took place. Identify hotspots of non-conformance,
highlight and seperate from noise.

Global feedback (conformance) bases on aggregated fitness measure. Quantify
overall conformance of the model and the event log.

-> Condenses (non)conformance into single value. Hard to interpret in terms of absolute value

Keep in mind that deviation is not necessary negative and therefore has to be eliminated.
Major deviation can just show that the model does not reflect the real world circumstances.

== Relational Techniques == 

Approach question of conformance based on binary behavioral relations

* Fine-granular representation of behavior and thus feedback on non-conformance
* Model enables aggregation of feedback in straight forward manner
