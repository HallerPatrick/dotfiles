= Deterministice Process Mining Algorithm =

Mainly alpha-Algorithm

It takes an event log as input and calculates the
ordering relations of the events contained in the log.

== Alpha Algorithm ==

* Detects concurrent execution of activities
* Relatively easy
* Not robust against noise

Create workflow log fro case ids:
    W = {ABCD, ACBD, EF}
    
Direct successor: a > b,  if b follows a in at least one trace
Causality:        a -> b, if a > b and not b > a
Concurrency:      a || b, a > b and b > a
Exclusiveness:    a # b,  a > b and not b > a
