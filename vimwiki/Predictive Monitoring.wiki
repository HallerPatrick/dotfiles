= Predictive Monitoring =

*Predictive monitoring detects cases with certain behavioral characteristics early.*

Answer questions on running cases of proceses:
    * Anticipate abnormal behaviour
    * project future resource requirements
    * predict compliance violations
    * implement counter measures

== Times of Prediction == 

*Time-based*: When will something happen and how long?
*Outcome-based*: What will be the result?
*Activity-based*: Will the case show certain behaviour in terms of activity execution


== Model-based Prediction ==

Prediction is based on process model

== Feature-based Prediction ==

Prediction query is based on learned features.


== Predictive Monitoring == 

*Idea*: Take logs as a starting ppoint to derive features to answer prediction queries
on the future of cases.
