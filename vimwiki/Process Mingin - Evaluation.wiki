== Underfitting/Overfitting ==

If a process model is to general, it is said
to be underfitting. It is insufficiently precise.
It allows for execution of activities which 
are not represented in the event logs. (Implicit sequences?)


= Evaluation Dimension =

- Fitness          - Quantifies the extent to which the discovered
                     model can accurately reproduce the cases recorded in the log
                     
                   - Measure: Is normalized over number of consumed and produced tokens
            
- Precision        - Quantifies the fraction of behavior allowed in the model
                     which is not seen in the event logs
                   - Measure is normalized over the number of transitions of model
                       -  Determine number of enabled transitions during replay of trace

- Simplicity       - Complexity of process model
                   - Measure: In general number of model elements
                   - Various structural measures:
                       - Diameter
                       - Density
                       - Coefficient of Connectivity
                       - Node Degress
                       - Cyclicity
                       - Depth

- Generalizibility - Extend to which the model will be able to reproduce future behavior
                     of the model
