== Perfomance Analysis ==

*Measures*:
    * Time
        * Processing time
        * Wait time
        * Cycle time
    * Cost
        * Per instance cost
        * Distinguis between value adding and non-value adding activites
    * Quality
        * Product quality: Defect rate
        * Delivery quality
        * Customer satisfaction

== Process Simulation ==

1. Model the process 
2. Definde simulation scenario 
3. Run Simulation
4. Analyze output 
5. Repeat for alternative scenarios
