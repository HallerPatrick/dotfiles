= Fuzzy Miner =

Fuzzy Miner does not use BPMN notation or petri, but
a dependency graph representation. Does not contain
gateways operators, but shows the dependencies between
different activities.

-> Creates a view on process model based on significance
and correlation

Means to cope with complexity
    - Aggregation and Clustering
    - Abstraction: remove low level information
    - Emphasis: significant information


*Idea*:
    - Highly significant behavior is preserved
    - Less significant, but highly correlated is clustered
    - Less significant and less correlated behavior is abstracted

Significance metrics:
    - Frequency of task
    - Count of predecessors and sucessors

== Fuzzy Miner Technique ==

Based on alpha algorithm.

Based on significance and correlation metrics transrom graph by:
    - Edge filtering
    - Aggregation and abstraction
